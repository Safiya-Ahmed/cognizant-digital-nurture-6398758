When I faced a merge conflict, Git showed me the files with conflicts. I opened those files, looked for the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>), and manually fixed the changes I wanted to keep. After that, I staged the resolved files using git add, committed with git commit and then completed the merge.
