ðŸ”€ Branching and Merging in Git
Branching in Git allows me to create a separate line of development to work on new features without affecting the main code. I used git branch and git checkout to create and switch between branches. Once my changes were complete, I used git merge to bring the updates back into the master branch. This helps keep development organized and avoids conflicts.
