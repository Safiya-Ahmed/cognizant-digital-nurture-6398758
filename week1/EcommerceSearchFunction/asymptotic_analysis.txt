Big O Notation Explanation:

Big O notation describes the performance (time or space complexity) of an algorithm as the input size grows.

1. Linear Search:
   - Best Case: O(1) -> When the element is at the start.
   - Average Case: O(n)
   - Worst Case: O(n) -> When the element is at the end or not found.

2. Binary Search:
   - Best Case: O(1) -> If the element is exactly at the middle.
   - Average Case: O(log n)
   - Worst Case: O(log n)

Comparison:
- Linear Search works on unsorted data and is simple, but slow for large datasets.
- Binary Search is fast (logarithmic time) but only works on sorted data.

Recommendation:
For optimized e-commerce search functionality, Binary Search is preferred when the product list is sorted and frequently searched.
