Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself to solve a problem. It breaks a problem into smaller subproblems of the same type, simplifying the overall logic.

Example Use Case in Financial Forecasting:
Recursion can help calculate future values where each value depends on previous ones â€” such as compound interest or year-wise growth projections.
