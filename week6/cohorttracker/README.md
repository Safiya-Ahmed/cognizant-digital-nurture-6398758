Styling makes a React app look good and user-friendly. Without proper styles, even a well-functioning app can feel dull or confusing. In React, styles help define how each component appears on the screen. Since components are reusable, keeping styles modular and organized is important for maintaining and scaling the app.

CSS Modules let you write scoped styles, meaning the styles apply only to the specific component. This avoids name conflicts and keeps the CSS clean. You import styles as objects and use them like className={styles.container}.

Inline styles are written directly inside the component using a JavaScript object.
