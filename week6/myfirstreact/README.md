A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web app that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content without reloading the whole page. This makes user interactions faster and smoother.

Benefits:

Quick navigation and response time

Less load on the server

Better user experience, like using an app

Easier to turn into a mobile app later

React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook for building interactive user interfaces, especially SPAs. It breaks the UI into reusable components and updates only the parts that change using a virtual DOM.

How it works:

You build UI using components

React tracks changes using virtual DOM

Only the changed parts are updated in the actual DOM — this saves time and boosts performance


Differences Between SPA and MPA
 A Single Page Application (SPA) doesn't reload the entire page when you navigate — only the required content gets updated, making it feel fast and seamless. In contrast, a Multi Page Application (MPA) loads a new page from the server every time you click a link, which can slow down the experience.

SPAs are generally faster after the first load because they fetch data dynamically and reduce server calls. MPAs, on the other hand, place more load on the backend since each action often triggers a full-page refresh and a fresh server request.

When it comes to SEO, MPAs have an edge because each page is separately indexed by search engines. SPAs need extra configurations to be search engine friendly. Common examples of SPAs include Gmail and Twitter's web app, while MPAs include sites like Amazon and Wikipedia.

Pros & Cons of Single-Page Applications
Pros:

Smooth user experience

Fast interactions after first load

Easier to build mobile versions

Cons:

SEO can be tricky

Initial loading time may be longer

JavaScript-heavy (can break if JS fails)

React lets you build modern, responsive user interfaces with ease. You work with components that manage their own state and can be reused across the app. It’s great for SPAs and has a strong community and ecosystem.

The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM that React uses behind the scenes. When something changes, React updates the virtual DOM first, compares it with the old version, and then updates only the necessary parts in the real DOM. This makes updates fast and efficient.

Key Features of React 
Component-based: Build UI using reusable pieces

JSX: Mix HTML with JavaScript easily

Virtual DOM: Faster updates and rendering

One-way data flow: Data moves in one direction for better control

Hooks: Add state and lifecycle features to functions

Strong community: Lots of tools and support
