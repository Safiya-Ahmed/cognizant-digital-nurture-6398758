React components are the building blocks of a React app. They are reusable pieces of code that define how a part of the user interface (UI) should look and behave. Each component can manage its own data (called state) and respond to user interactions.

While both React components and JavaScript functions can take input and return output, there are some key differences:

A JavaScript function just performs a task and returns a value.

A React component returns JSX (which looks like HTML) and is used to render UI.

React components can also handle state and lifecycle methods, while normal functions cannot.

There are mainly two types of React components:

Class Components – These are ES6 classes that extend React.Component. They can have state and lifecycle methods.

Function Components – These are simple JavaScript functions that return JSX. With React Hooks, they can now also handle state and lifecycle features.

A class component is written using a JavaScript class and provides more features like state handling and lifecycle methods. Class components were the standard before React Hooks were introduced.

A function component is a simpler way to create a component using a plain JavaScript function. Earlier, it was used only for displaying static content, but now with Hooks it can also manage state and side effects

In a class component, the constructor is a special method used to initialize the component's state and bind event handlers. It’s called before the component is mounted.

The render() function is required in every class component. It returns the JSX that should be displayed on the screen. React calls this method whenever it needs to update the UI.
