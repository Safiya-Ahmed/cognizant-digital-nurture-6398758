✅ Features of ES6
ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced many powerful features that made JavaScript cleaner and more efficient. Some key features include:

let and const for block-scoped variable declarations

Arrow functions (=>)

Classes and inheritance

Template literals (using backticks ``)

Default parameters in functions

Spread (...) and rest (...) operators

Destructuring for arrays and objects

New data structures like Map and Set

Modules using import and export

JavaScript let
The let keyword allows me to declare variables that are block-scoped. Unlike var, variables declared with let are not hoisted to the top of their scope and are only accessible within the block they are defined in. This makes let a safer and more predictable option.

✅ Difference between var and let 
Scope:
var is function-scoped, while let is block-scoped.

Hoisting:
Both are hoisted, but var is initialized as undefined whereas let is not accessible before declaration (temporal dead zone).

Redeclaration:
var allows redeclaration in the same scope, let does not.

Use Case:
let is preferred in modern JavaScript for safer, more predictable variable handling.

✅ ES6 Class Fundamentals
ES6 introduced class syntax to make object-oriented programming in JavaScript more intuitive. A class contains a constructor and methods, and is just syntactic sugar over JS’s prototype system.

✅ ES6 Arrow Functions
Arrow functions (=>) are a shorter way to write functions. They also don’t bind their own this, which is useful in many cases like callbacks.

✅ ES6 Class Inheritance
I can create subclasses using the extends keyword. The super() function is used to call the parent class’s constructor.

✅ Set() and Map() in ES6
Set() is a collection of unique values. Duplicate values are automatically removed.
Map() is a collection of key-value pairs and the keys can be any type (even objects or functions).
