React events are interactions triggered by the user, like clicks, key presses, form submissions, and more. React handles these events similarly to HTML, but with a consistent, cross-browser approach. These events allow components to respond to user input dynamically.

Event handlers are functions that run when a specific event occurs. In React, I can assign event handlers directly in JSX using props like onClick, onChange, etc. 

React wraps native DOM events inside a SyntheticEvent object. This synthetic event system ensures that events work identically across all browsers. It also improves performance by reusing event objects through event pooling.

In React, event names use camelCase instead of lowercase as in HTML. 

Also, event handler values are passed as functions (not strings like in HTML). This follows JavaScript conventions and helps keep code consistent.
