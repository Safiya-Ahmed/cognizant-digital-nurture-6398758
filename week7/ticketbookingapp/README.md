Conditional rendering in React means showing different UI elements based on certain conditions (like if/else). I can use JavaScript operators inside JSX — such as if, ternary ? :, or && — to render elements only when specific conditions are met.

Element variables are used to store JSX elements in a variable, which can be conditionally assigned and rendered. It makes rendering logic cleaner.

To prevent rendering, I can use a return null in the component. This tells React to skip rendering that component without errors.
